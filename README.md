======================

A sample Selenium WebDriver project showcasing my skills as a Test Automation Engineer.

It's a maven project featuring two modules:
 - one is the library for automating the gui, built on top of Selenium WebDriver;
   it comes with the page objects and their unit tests
 - the other module contains the functional tests, and leverages the former

Features:
 - fine-grained Page Objects (Page and PageComponent hierarchies)
 -
